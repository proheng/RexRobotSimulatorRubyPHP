Toy Robot Simulator
Requirements
PHP 5.2 or later
Ruby 1.9 or later

Instruction
The application is programmed to run in terminal. 
Example:
	without argument
		ruby robot.rb
		./robot.rb 
		php robot.php
	with argument
		php robot.php test.log
		./robot.rb test.log

If launching application without argument, application will prompt for command.
If launching application with argument, application 


Assumption
1.	According to requirement quoted, 
	'A robot that is not on the table can choose the ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and REPORT commands.'	,
	robot can be assumed to be placed outside of table range, 
	but it will not accept command until it is brought back 
2.  According to constraint, quoted,
	'The toy robot must not fall off the table during movement. This also includes the initial placement of the toy robot.',
	the initial placement cannot out of table, but the placement after a valid initial one can out of table.
	
	Thus, for the first placement out of table, the application will flag and ignore the command, until the very first valid placement.
	
I enjoy this small task and will be more than happy to program any other application like this as my interest.
